# Implementation Plan: Material Planning and Cut Optimization

**Branch**: `001-material-planning-web` | **Date**: 2025-10-08 | **Spec**: C:\Users\schoc\Documents\Git\Privat\plank-cut-planner\specs\001-material-planning-web\spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `C:\Users\schoc\Documents\Git\Privat\plank-cut-planner\specs\001-material-planning-web\spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Web app to compute the cheapest plank purchase plan and a cut plan (no 90° rotation; cuts along length), with local persistence. UI: Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vuetify 3; state: Pinia + VueUse; visualization: SVG. Target <1.0s recompute; disable auto‑recompute if exceeded.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Vue 3)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vue 3, Vuetify 3, Pinia, Vue Router, @vueuse/core  
**Storage**: Local browser storage via VueUse `useLocalStorage`  
**Testing**: Vitest, @vue/test-utils, jsdom  
**Target Platform**: Web (latest Chrome/Edge)
**Project Type**: Single frontend project  
**Performance Goals**: Recompute under 1.0s; auto‑recompute disables if exceeded  
**Constraints**: No rotation; cuts along length; availability caps; unit toggle mm/inch; currency display  
**Scale/Scope**: Small datasets (tens of SKUs, hundreds of pieces)

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Visual Design & Theming: Vuetify 3 tokens in `src/styles/settings.scss`. PASS
- Responsive & Mobile‑first: Vuetify grid; 360–1920px; touch targets ≥44px. PASS
- Component‑Driven & Type Safety: Vue 3 + TS strict; Pinia; composables. PASS
- Workflow & Quality Gates: eslint/vue-tsc; Vitest in CI. PASS

**Structure Decision**: [Document the selected structure and reference the real
directories captured above]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
